# Toxic-content-classification-using-machine-learning-and-deep-learning
Built a Toxic Content Classification project using ML &amp; DL. Applied preprocessing, EDA, and trained Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes &amp; CNN models. Compared performance via accuracy, F1 &amp; ROC curves. Deployed an interactive predictor to detect toxic vs non-toxic comments.
